### Issue: Supporting IDent /producer tags

**Description:**
We need to add support for IDent /producer tags in the project to enhance metadata handling and improve data interchange capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Define the expected behavior for IDent /producer tags.
2. Implement parsing for these tags in the existing framework.
3. Write tests to ensure proper functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
Consider looking into existing implementations and how they handle metadata tags effectively.
